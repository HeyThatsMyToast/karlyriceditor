**Karaoke Lyrics Editor** is a program which lets you edit and synchronize lyrics with karaoke songs in various formats. Currently supported formats include LRC, LRCv2 (supported by XBMC) and Ultrastar (without pitch). Export into the CD+G format is supported,
 as well as export into video. Unlike just regular lyrics available everywhere, lyrics suitable for karaoke players need to have timing  marks which tell the player when to show a specific line, and when and how highlight the words. It has many unique features which are missing even in the expensive commercial software.
 
It features full support for non-English languages, support for CDG, LRC and UltraStar specifics, and built-in karaoke testing window.

Unlike most lyrics editors for Linux, it is self-sufficient, and does not depend on KDE or some external players. Karaoke Lyrics Editor  is available for Linux and Windows, and uses the Qt toolkit and FFMpeg libraries.

Karaoke Lyric Editor is licensed under GNU GPL version 3, and is written by George Yunaev.
